# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: December 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**

I made a simple index.html with canvas to handle Tetris game board does the following:

* Have basic game loop
* Have a base block dropping from the top
* Stop the block when it hits the bottom) and spawn new block
* Handle basic input from the keyboard input

**Thoughts:** 

Build everything from the start is quite ... painful when there is no framework
to support some common actions (such handling inputs and game loop). This generally
implies the main responbility goes down to me.
